Aaarto is an online drawing program that enables the minting of art work as an NFT on the Hedera network. 

The drawing application part of Aaarto enables the creation of art by the adding of circles and squares of various sizes and colors onto a canvas area. Tools to set the shapes' sizes and colors are offered to the user. An erase tool is offered to enable the deletion of the shapes applied to the canvas.

At any point in the creation of the art, the user can create an NFT of the art.

With the Aaarto program, the process of creating the art and the characteristics of the NFT are tightly connected. The characteristics of NFT are controlled by a single creation mechanism. Not just any digital asset is minted. The connection between the creation process and the NFT overcomes the generality of the uploading of digital data. The artwork generated by Aaarto is in the SVG format. SVG data is stored as SVG tags (tags that give information about the content of the file). This data gives insight into the content of the artwork. This insight into the structure of the artwork is preferable to a series of pixels. A series of pixel data has no inherent way of indicating what the content of the artwork is.   

## An example of a SVG files' contents

```
<svg version="1.1" width="300" height="300" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="gray" />
    <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="80" fill="green" />
</svg>
```

## User Journey

- On initial view of Aaarto, the user is presented with a drawing application. This drawing application is simple. A button with the label "Open Wallet" is also present.

- The user can draw images with the application and at any time select the "Open Wallet" button.

- The user presses the "Open Wallet" button and the application Aaarto connects with the users' wallet. The "Open Wallet" button changes to display the icon of a wallet. The user can click on the wallet icon to open the users' wallet at any time.

- Once the users' wallet is open they can mint an NFT. The user is presented with a button that is labeled "Mint NFT".
 
- Once the user initiates the minting, they are prompted for the name of the artwork. When all required data is supplied, the user is presented with a button "Create" that will create the artwork as an NFT.

- The NFT will be saved to the users' wallet.


## Future Roadmap

The key concept of linking the creation program to the minting can be scaled to other styles of art. A system that is based on the styles of the painter Mondrian could be developed.
